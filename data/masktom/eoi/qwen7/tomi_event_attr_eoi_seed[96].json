From the events, we know that the trousers are currently in the pantry (event 8). However, to determine where Mila will look for them, we need to know the last place she saw them. Since Mila entered the back_yard, exited the back_yard, and entered the basement, but did not interact with the trousers in those locations, the last place she saw them would be the back_yard. Therefore, the entities needed are the location of the trousers (which is the pantry) and the place where Mila last saw the trousers (which is the back_yard). However, since the question asks for at most five entities and their attributes, and we are limited to directly mentioned entities, we list the current location of the trousers and the implication of the last seen location.",
