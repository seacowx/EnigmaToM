The question asks where Elizabeth thinks Logan searches for the green_pepper. This implies we are looking for entities related to the question: Elizabeth, Logan, and the green_pepper. Since the question does not specify a location directly but implies a search, we can infer that a location or object where the green_pepper could be or is related to the search might be relevant. However, the question itself only directly mentions Elizabeth, Logan, and the green_pepper.\n\nGiven the constraints and focusing on the question's content:\n\n<entities>\n- Elizabeth\n- Logan\n- green_pepper\n</entities>\n\nThese are the entities directly mentioned in the question. Since we are asked to include at least one entity that is not a person and not to exceed five entities, and considering the question's context, the above list is comprehensive and adheres to the instructions.",
