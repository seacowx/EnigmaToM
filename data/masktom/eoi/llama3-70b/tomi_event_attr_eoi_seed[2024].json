Nathan was initially in the TV room, where the broccoli was located in a bottle. However, he exited the TV room and became unaware of William, which implies he also became unaware of any changes in the TV room after his exit. The question does not directly mention any other events or locations that Nathan is aware of regarding the broccoli's current location.\n\nGiven this context, the key entities and their attributes that are directly relevant to answering the question are:\n\n<entities>\n- Location of broccoli \n- Awareness of Nathan \n- Location of Nathan \n- Contents of TV room \n- Previous location of broccoli\n</entities>\n\nThese entities and attributes are crucial because they directly relate to where Nathan last knew the broccoli to be (in the TV room, in a bottle) and his current state of awareness about the broccoli's location. Since Nathan is not aware of any changes after he left the TV room, he would likely look for the broccoli in its last known location to him, which is the TV room.",

However, the undershirt is initially in the treasure chest, which is in the staircase, and then it's moved to a drawer, also in the staircase. Since the question is about where Nathan will look for the undershirt, we need to consider the locations associated with the undershirt and Nathan's awareness of these locations.\n\nHere are the entities and their attributes relevant to answering the question:\n\n<entities>\n- Location of undershirt \n- Location of treasure chest \n- Location of drawer \n- Awareness of Nathan \n- Location of staircase\n</entities>\n\nThese entities and attributes are directly relevant because they either describe the current or past locations of the undershirt (which Nathan is looking for) or the potential places Nathan might search based on his movements and awareness. The staircase is included as it's the overarching location where both the treasure chest and the drawer (and thus the undershirt at different times) are found, and it's where Nathan has been. Nathan's awareness is crucial as it might influence where he decides to look for the undershirt, though the events do not specify his awareness of the undershirt's movement.",
