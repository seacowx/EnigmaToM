The events list mentions locations and objects, but since we must stick strictly to what is directly mentioned in the question or implied by the instruction to include at least one non-person entity, we focus on \"the peas\" as the directly mentioned entity.\n\nBut to fulfill the request for up to five entities and considering the need for at least one non-person entity (which \"the peas\" satisfies), and given that no other entities are directly mentioned in the question, we still only have \"the peas\" directly from the question. The instruction to not include entities indicating time and to reason about the content of the questions suggests focusing on what is explicitly asked, which is the location of \"the peas\" at the beginning, without specifying other entities directly.\n\nThus, based on the strict interpretation of the instructions provided and focusing only on what is directly mentioned in the question:\n\n<entities>\n- the peas\n</entities>",
