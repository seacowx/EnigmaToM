The question specifically asks about Nathan's action regarding the turnip, implying we need to understand Nathan's awareness and the turnip's location.\n\nGiven that Nathan was aware of other characters and their actions (event 9), and considering Aiden's belief that the turnip was safely moved (event 10), we can infer that Nathan might look for the turnip based on the information he has about its last known location or where it was moved to.
