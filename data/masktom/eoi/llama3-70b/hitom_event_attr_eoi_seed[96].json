Since the questions are about what individuals think about the cucumber's location, we don't need to infer beyond what is directly mentioned regarding perceptions and locations.\n\n<entities>\n- location of cucumber \n- perception of Avery \n- perception of Abigail \n- perception of Hannah \n- perception of Owen \n</entities>\n\nHowever, to better fit the requested format and focus on non-person entities as well, we can refine this list. The primary non-person entity involved in the questions is the cucumber, and the attribute of interest is its location. The perceptions of the individuals are attributes of those individuals, but since we need at least one non-person entity and should focus on direct mentions, we simplify to:\n\n<entities>\n- location of cucumber \n- perception of Avery \n- perception of Abigail \n- perception of Hannah \n- perception of Owen \n</entities>\n\nBut to strictly adhere to the format and the instruction to include at least one entity that is not a person and to directly mention entities without inference, we recognize that \"perception of\" is an attribute of the person, not a separate entity. Thus, focusing on the direct question content:\n\n<entities>\n- location of cucumber \n- Avery's belief \n- Abigail's belief \n- Hannah's belief \n- Owen's belief \n</entities>\n\nThis list captures the essence of what is needed to answer the questions: the actual location of the cucumber and the beliefs of the individuals about its location.",
