However, since Jackson has already left the closet, he would not search there. Therefore, the only place Jackson would think to search for the undershirt is the pantry, where it was moved.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the relevant entities and their attributes are:\n\n<entities>\n- location of undershirt\n- location of pantry\n</entities>\n\nThe \"location of undershirt\" refers to the place where the undershirt was last known to be, which is the closet.
