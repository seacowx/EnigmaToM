Olivia moved the sweet_potato to a container, which was also in the staircase. Hunter and Olivia both exited the staircase, and Hunter then entered the porch.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that Hunter would likely search for the sweet_potato in the staircase, as that is the last known location where the sweet_potato was present. Olivia, who was present in the staircase when Hunter was there, would likely think that Hunter searches for the sweet_potato in the staircase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the relevant entities and their attributes are:\n\n<entities>\n- location of sweet_potato\n- location of container\n- location of staircase\n- location of porch\n- presence of Hunter in staircase\n</entities>\n\nThe \"location of sweet_potato\" and \"location of container\" are attributes that are important because they indicate the last known locations of the sweet_potato and the container, respectively. The \"location of staircase\" and \"location of porch\" are attributes that help us understand the spatial context.
