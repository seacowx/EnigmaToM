Ella exited the laundry.\n\nFrom these events, we can deduce that the peach was initially in the suitcase, which was in the laundry. Oliver moved the peach to the basket, which was also in the laundry. Therefore, Ella will look for the peach in the basket, which is in the laundry.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant entities:\n\n<entities>\n- Peach\n- Basket\n- Laundry\n</entities>\n\nNote that \"Ella\" is not an entity in this context, as the question is about where she will look for the peach, not where she is looking.
