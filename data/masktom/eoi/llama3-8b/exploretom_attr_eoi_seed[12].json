room, only to be matched by the nearly inaudible sound of Kennedy's shoes touching the floor.\n4: Kennedy's eyes scanned the operations room, fixing on the metal toolbox before moving swiftly to deposit the tactical flashlight inside; Riley's ears perked up at Kennedy's whispered words, \"Toolbox, got it?\" Jessica stepped into the operations room, her eyes scanning the area with the practiced ease of a skilled medic.\n5: \"Roster update,\" Kennedy announced, making sure everyone was informed about the tactical flashlight's location within the metal toolbox.\n6: The hum of machinery and quiet murmur of conversation swirled around Jessica as she began restocking medical supplies.\n7: As the doorway closed behind Riley, she quickly found her bearings within the operations room, expertly navigating between the banks of computer screens and rows of lockers with practiced ease.\n8: In the brief time it took her to cross the room, her eyes had adeptly taken in the various

view, leaving the muffled sounds of the operations room to fade into the background as she walked away.\n10: A flash of movement caught the edge of Kennedy's vision as the tactical flashlight changed hands, its new home the plastic storage bin where it now rested.\n11: The sounds of the operations room enveloped Riley as she slipped inside, a swift glance taking in the lay of the land - medical supplies were being restocked by Jessica, and it was clear metal and plastic storage were serving a very specific purpose for someone.\n12: In the next moment, her eyes locked onto Kennedy.\n13: A whispered message reached Riley's ears, and without breaking stride, she adjusted her mental map of the room's layout to reflect the tactical flashlight's new residence within the plastic storage bin.\n14: Her eyes drifted from Kennedy back to the room at large, where Jessica continued restocking medical supplies.\n15: With the swift, sure movement of a seasoned veteran, Colton slid the
