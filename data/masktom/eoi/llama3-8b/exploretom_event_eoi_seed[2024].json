This implies that Madison believes the walkie-talkie is permanently connected to the stadium's private channel.\n\nHowever, the questions also ask about the beliefs of James and Eric regarding the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel. This implies that James and Eric may not believe the walkie-talkie is permanently connected to the private channel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the questions to extract the entities involved:\n\n- Madison's beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n- James' beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n- Eric's beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n- The room where Madison thinks James will search for the walkie-talkie\n- The room where Madison thinks Eric will search for the walkie-talkie\n- The room where James thinks Madison will search for the walkie-talkie\n- The room where James thinks Eric will search for the walkie-talkie\n- The room where Eric thinks James will search for the walkie-talkie\n- The room where Eric thinks Madison will search for the walkie-talkie\n- Madison's beliefs about James' and Eric's beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n- James' beliefs about Madison's and Eric's beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n- Eric's beliefs about James' and Madison's beliefs about the walkie-talkie's connection to the private channel\n\nHowever, the entities mentioned in the questions are:\n- Madison\n- James\n- Eric\n- Walkie-talkie\n- Private channel\n- Room\n\nBut, the question asks for at most five entities. Therefore, we can remove 'Room' as it is not a specific entity but a location. \n\n<entities>\n- Madison\n- James\n- Eric\n- Walkie-talkie\n- Private channel\n</entities>",

        "original_generation": "To extract the entities involved in the list of questions, we need to analyze the content of the questions. The questions are about the script, its attributes (colored sticky tabs marking important scenes), and the rooms where people will search for the script.\n\nBased on the analysis, the entities involved in the list of questions are:\n\n- The script\n- The production room\n- The sticky tabs\n- The index of songs\n- The windows\n\nHowever, the index of songs is not directly mentioned in the provided list of <Events> and is only mentioned in one of the questions. Therefore, we will exclude it from the list.\n\nHere is the list of entities with the following format:\n\n<entities>\n- The script\n- The production room\n- The sticky tabs\n- The windows\n</entities>\n\nNote that the sticky tabs are a type of object, but they are also mentioned as a feature of the script. However, in the context of the questions, they are treated as a separate entity.",
