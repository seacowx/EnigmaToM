This implies that we need to find the current location of the sweet_potato.\n\nFrom the list of events, we can see that the sweet_potato is initially mentioned in event 4, where it is stated that \"The sweet_potato is in the envelope.\" However, the envelope is not mentioned in the questions, so we will not include it in the list of entities.\n\nThe questions do not mention the envelope, but they do mention the sweet_potato, which is an object.
