inside, the soft chatter and aroma of stale coffee enveloping her like a familiar blanket.\n4: Jasmine's hands moved swiftly across the room, her fingers closing around the stethoscope as if guarding a valuable secret, before slipping it into the metal toolbox with the quiet clink of tools shifting.\n5: Without being noticed, Amelia followed a private clue that led her straight to the metal toolbox, her determination reignited.\n6: Madison's eyes sparkled with intrigue as she witnessed the exchange, sensing that Jasmine's control over the stethoscope was far from casual.\n7: Jasmine'squiet tone carried across to Madison, her hushed words leaving no doubt that the stethoscope was safely hidden in the metal toolbox.\n8: The staff lounge door swung open once more, admitting Amelia and Mia in swift succession, their separate trajectories intersecting briefly before diverging into distinct pursuits.\n9: As the staff lounge bustled with renewed activity, Jasmine subtly adjusted her position, allowing her to keep a watchful eye on the now seemingly empty metal toolbox and the nearby canvas bag that momentarily eclipsed her attention.\n10: The stethoscope, once hidden in the toolbox, had found a new resting place inside the unassuming canvas bag, its location shifted with a quiet deliberateness.\n11: The door to the staff lounge creaked shut, silencing the murmurs within as Mia made her way back to the bustling hospital floor.\n12: The gentle chime of a microwave greeted Madison's ears as she slipped into the staff lounge, muted conversations swaddling her in an all-too-familiar ambiance.\n13: In the heart of this well-worn sanctuary, Jasmine and a light canvas bag became her focal points, edgy promise etched into the cocoon of quiet murmur.\n14: Jasmine
