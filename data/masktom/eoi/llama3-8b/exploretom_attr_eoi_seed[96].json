The questions also imply that the characters are aware of each other's actions and possibly their thoughts about the festival marketing strategies.\n\nTo answer the questions, we need to extract entities and their attributes that are directly mentioned in the questions. The entities that are relevant to answering the questions are:\n\n- The stuffed rabbit\n- The storage trailer\n- The main tent\n- Leslie\n- Isabella\n- Colton\n\nHowever, we are asked to include at most five entities and their attributes. Since the questions do not directly ask about the stuffed rabbit's attributes, we can exclude it. The storage trailer and the main tent are also relevant entities, but they are not directly asked about in the questions. Therefore, we can exclude them as well.\n\nThe remaining entities are Leslie, Isabella, and Colton.
