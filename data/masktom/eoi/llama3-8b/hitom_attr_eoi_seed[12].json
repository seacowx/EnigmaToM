The entities that are relevant to the questions are:\n\n1. Tangerine\n2. Plum\n3. Locations (bottle, treasure chest, bathtub, bucket, bottle, suitcase, crate, drawer)\n4.

Therefore, we can exclude the plum as an entity.\n\nWe are left with the tangerine and locations. However, we need to include attributes of these entities to answer the questions.

The green envelope and the blue container are the locations where the spinach is initially and later moved, respectively.
