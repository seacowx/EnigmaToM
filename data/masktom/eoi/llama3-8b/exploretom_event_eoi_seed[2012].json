Does Madison know about security protocols for the event? Answer yes or no.\n   - Based on event 6, Madison briefs Eric on security measures, so Madison knows about security protocols.\n\n2. Does Madison know about concession stand inventory? Answer yes or no.\n   - Based on event 10, Madison passes on concession stand data to Eric, so Madison knows about concession stand inventory.\n\n3. Does Madison know about scheduling for the halftime show? Answer yes or no.\n   - There is no event that directly indicates Madison knows about the halftime show schedule. However, event 4 states that Eric briefs Madison on the event schedule, which might include the halftime show. But since there is no direct event that indicates Madison knows about the halftime show schedule, we cannot confirm this.\n\n4. Does Eric know about security protocols for the event? Answer yes or no.\n   - Based on event 6, Madison briefs Eric on security measures, so Eric knows about security protocols.\n\n5. Does Eric know about concession stand inventory? Answer yes or no.\n   - Based on event 10, Madison passes on concession stand data to Eric, so Eric knows about concession stand inventory.\n\n6. Does Eric know about scheduling for the halftime show? Answer yes or no.\n   - Based on event 4, Eric briefs Madison on the event schedule, which might include the halftime show. Therefore, Eric knows about the event schedule, including the halftime show.\n\n7. What does Madison think about Eric's belief on security protocols for the event?

(knows about it / does not know about it)\n   - Since Madison passes on concession stand data to Eric (event 10), Madison knows that Eric knows about concession stand inventory.\n\n9. What does Madison think about Eric's belief on scheduling for the halftime show? (knows about it / does not know about it)\n   - Since Madison does not have direct knowledge about the halftime show schedule (question 3), Madison does not know about Eric's belief on the halftime show schedule.\n\n10. What does Eric think about Madison's belief on security protocols for the event? (knows about it / does not know about it)\n    - Since Eric is briefed by Madison on security measures (event 6), Eric knows that Madison knows about security protocols.\n\n11. What does Eric think about Madison's belief on concession stand inventory? (knows about it / does not know about it)\n    - Since Eric receives concession stand data from Madison (event 10), Eric knows that Madison knows about concession stand inventory.\n\n12.
