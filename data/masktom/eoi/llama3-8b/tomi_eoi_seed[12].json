The question is asking about the location of the peas at the beginning. The entities involved in this question are:\n\n- peas\n- box\n\nHowever, the question also implies that the box is in a certain location, which is the dining_room. Therefore, we should also include the dining_room as an entity.\n\nAdditionally, the question does not mention any other entities that are not already included. \n\nSo, the list of entities involved in the question is:\n\n<entities>\n- peas\n- box\n- dining_room\n</entities>\n\nHowever, since we are asked to include at most five entities, we can add the entity \"at the beginning\" which is implied by the question, but it is not a specific entity. We can replace it with the entity \"the beginning\" which is also implied, but it is not a specific entity. We can replace it with the entity \"where\" which is a specific entity. However, we can also include the entity \"the\" which is also a specific entity.\n\nSo, the list of entities involved in the question is:\n\n<entities>\n- peas\n- box\n- dining_room\n- the\n- where\n</entities>\n\nHowever, the entity \"the\" is not a specific entity that is directly related to the question. The entity \"where\" is also not a specific entity that is directly related to the question. We can replace them with the entity \"location\" which is implied by the question, but it is not a specific entity.
