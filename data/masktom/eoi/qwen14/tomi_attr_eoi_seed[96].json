The key information here is the last known location of the undershirt and the actions taken by Mason and Jacob. The undershirt was initially in the suitcase, which was in the den. Mason then moved the undershirt to the box, which is also in the den. Jacob entered and exited the den twice, but there is no indication of Jacob knowing about the movement of the undershirt from the suitcase to the box.
