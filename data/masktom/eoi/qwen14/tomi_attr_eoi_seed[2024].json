Then Noah moved the peach to the drawer, which is also in the staircase. Owen entered and exited the staircase but did not interact with the peach. Therefore, the question \"Where will Owen look for the peach?\" is related to the location of the peach and the places Owen has been.\n\nSince the question does not ask about any specific attributes of the peach, box, or drawer, and only inquires about the location, we can infer that the relevant entities are the locations where the peach could be found based on the events. The box and the drawer are the only locations mentioned for the peach, and the staircase is the only place Owen has been that could contain the drawer or box.\n\n<entities>\n- location of peach\n- location of box\n- location of drawer\n- location of staircase\n</entities>\n\nHowever, since we are limited to five entities and their attributes and only the peach's location is directly asked about in the question, we can simplify this to:\n\n<entities>\n- location of peach\n- location of box\n- location of drawer\n- location of staircase\n</entities>\n\nBut since we need to adhere strictly to the instruction of having at most five entities and their attributes, and considering the question's focus, we can further refine it to:\n\n<entities>\n- location of peach\n- location of box\n- location of drawer\n</entities>\n\nThis list includes the most relevant entities to answer the question about where Owen will look for the peach.",
