The cherry and its locations are not directly asked about in the questions, but Jacob's belief about the cherry's location is mentioned, which is relevant to his state of mind.\n\n<entities>\n- location of melon\n- location of green drawer\n- location of green bottle\n- belief of Jacob about location of melon\n- belief of Lily about belief of Jacob about location of melon\n</entities>",
