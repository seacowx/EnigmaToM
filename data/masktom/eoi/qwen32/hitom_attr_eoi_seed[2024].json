Note that one entity could corresponds to multiple attributes. List the entities and their attributes. For instance, if the \"location of tie\", \"placement of tie\", and \"color of crate\" are important for answering the questions, the response should be formatted as follows:\n\n<entities>\n- location of tie \n- placement of tie \n- color of crate\n</entities>\n\nYou must include at least one entity that is not a person. Only extract entities directly mentioned in the questions, do not make any further inference. Do not include any entities that indicate a time or point in time. First briefly reason about the content of the events and the questions and then provide a comprehensive list of at most five entities and their attributes with the following format:\n\n<entities>\n- attribute of entity \n- attribute of entity \n...\n</entities>",
