        "original_generation": "Based on the events and the question \"Where will Aiden look for the sweatshirt?\", we can reason that the location of the sweatshirt is important. Initially, the sweatshirt was in the bottle, but it was later moved to the drawer. The drawer is in the workshop. Aiden was last seen entering the hall, but the question asks where he will look for the sweatshirt, which implies he might return to the workshop.\n\n<entities>\n- location of sweatshirt\n- location of drawer\n- location of bottle\n- location of workshop\n- location of Aiden\n</entities>",
