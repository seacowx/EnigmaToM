For instance, if the \"location of tie\", \"placement of tie\", and \"color of crate\" are important for answering the questions, the response should be formatted as follows:\n\n<entities>\n- location of tie \n- placement of tie \n- color of crate\n</entities>\n\nYou must include at least one entity that is not a person. Only extract entities directly mentioned in the questions, do not make any further inference. Do not include any entities that indicate a time or point in time. First briefly reason about the content of the events and the questions and then provide a comprehensive list of at most five entities and their attributes with the following format:\n\n<entities>\n- attribute of entity \n- attribute of entity \n...\n</entities>",
        "original_generation": "Based on the events and the question \"Where will Aiden look for the broccoli?\", we can reason that the location of the broccoli is crucial. Aiden has exited the kitchen, and the last known action involving the broccoli was Emma moving it to the crate. Therefore, the location of the crate and the broccoli are key pieces of information. The bottle, which initially contained the broccoli, is also mentioned and could be considered a potential place Aiden might think to look.\n\n<entities>\n- location of broccoli\n- location of crate\n- location of bottle\n- location of kitchen\n- last known action involving broccoli\n</entities>",
