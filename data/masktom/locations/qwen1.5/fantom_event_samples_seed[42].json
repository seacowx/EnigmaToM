Until next time!]\n2: [Sasha: Alright Ricardo, see you later. So, Cecilia, what do you think about long-distance relationships?]\n3: [Cecilia: Well, I had one a few years ago. It can be difficult at times because you miss the physical presence of your partner. But, it can also be a test of your compatibility and communication skills.]\n4: [Sasha: Absolutely, I think the same way. It really depends on how strongly both parties are committed to making it work despite the distance.]\n5: [Cecilia: Definitely. Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship, Sasha?]\n6: [Sasha: Yes, I have. It was tough, especially dealing with time differences and the lack of face-to-face interaction but we got through it by setting clear expectations and having good, honest communication.]\n7: [Cecilia: Indeed, Sasha. Every relationship has its own set of challenges and long-distance relationships have their own unique set. They are not for everyone but can work out if both partners are committed.]\n8: [Ricardo: Hey, I hope I didn't miss much. So what's up now?]\n9: [Cecilia: Hey Ricardo, welcome back. We were just talking about long-distance relationships.]\n10: [Sasha: We thought we might discuss some personal experiences about breakups and moving on. What do you think?]\n11: [Ricardo: Ah, breakups. Tough, but sometimes inevitable. I surely have had my fair share of them.]\n12: [Cecilia: I think we all have, Ricardo. The important part though, is learning and growing from these experiences.]\n13: [Sasha: Absolutely, Cecilia. Breakups can be really painful, but they also offer a chance for self-improvement and self-discovery.]\n14: [Ricardo: That's true, Sasha. After every breakup, I always make it a point to reflect on the relationship: What went wrong, what could have been done better. It helps me learn and grow.]\n15: [Cecilia: And not to forget, the importance of moving on. Sometimes it takes time, but eventually you have to let go and move forward.]\n16: [Ricardo: Absolutely Cecilia. The healing process might be tough and long but it's necessary.]\n17: [Sasha: And, of course, one day when we're ready, we'll hopefully be able to find love again, don't you think?]\n18: [Ricardo: Yes, Sasha, I couldn't agree more. Life goes on and so do we. Breakups just make us stronger and more aware of what we want in a relationship.]\n19: [Cecilia: Well put, Ricardo. And remember, it's okay to take your time to heal and rediscover yourself. You can't rush these things.]\n20: [Sasha: Definitely, Cecilia. It's all about taking your time and moving at your own pace. After all, we're all unique and heal in our own ways.]\n21: [Ricardo: Couldn't have said it better myself, Sasha. The progress might be slow or painful at times, but it's all part of the process.]\n22: [Cecilia: And someday, hopefully, we'll find that person who truly complements us and brings out the best in us.]\n23: [Sasha: Amen to that, Cecilia.\n\nWhat are the rooms mentioned in these events?
