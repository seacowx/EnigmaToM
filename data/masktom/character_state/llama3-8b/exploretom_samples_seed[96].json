Generate Madison's movements as a list in the following format:\n- <Event Index>: Madison <movement> <room>\n- <Event Index>: Madison <movement> <room>\n......\n\nDetermine Madison's movements according to the following instructions:\n- All of the location changes, if exist, are explicitly stated in the events.\n- If the event does not state that Madison left a room, assume that Madison remains in the previous room.\n- Use 'enter' to indicate that Madison enters a room and use 'exit' to indicate that Madison exits a room.\n\nGenerate the answers exactly as instructed without any explanation or note. Only generate the event indices where there is a location change, omit other events.",
