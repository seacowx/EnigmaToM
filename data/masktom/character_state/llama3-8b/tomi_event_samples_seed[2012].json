The cupboard is in the basement.\n10: Note: The last event \"The cupboard is in the basement\" is a statement of fact, but it's not an action or movement. It's more of a description of the cupboard's location. If we consider it as an event, it would be more accurate to say that the cupboard's location changed, but since the cupboard's location was already mentioned in the previous event, it's not necessary to include it as a separate event. However, to follow the instructions, I included it in the list.\n11: However, if we consider the cupboard's location change as an event, then the correct list would be:\n12: [REASONING CHAIN]\n13: 1. Jack entered the basement.\n14: 2. Isla entered the basement.\n15: 3. The onion is in the treasure_chest.\n16: 4. The treasure_chest is in the basement.\n17: 5. Jack exited the basement.\n18: 6. Jack entered the front_yard.\n19: 7. Isla moved the onion to the cupboard.\n20: 8. The cupboard is in the basement.\n21: 9. The cupboard's location changed (cupboard moved to the basement).\n22: But since the cupboard's location was already mentioned in the previous event, it's not necessary to include it as a separate event.\n\n<Available Rooms>\n- Basement\n- Front yard\n\nGiven the list of events and available rooms, track the movement of Isla throughout the events. Generate Isla's movements as a list in the following format:\n- <Event Index>: Isla <movement> <room>\n- <Event Index>: Isla <movement> <room>\n......\n\nDetermine Isla's movements according to the following instructions:\n- All of the location changes, if exist, are explicitly stated in the events.\n- If the event does not state that Isla left a room, assume that Isla remains in the previous room.\n- Use 'enter' to indicate that Isla enters a room and use 'exit' to indicate that Isla exits a room.\n\nGenerate the answers exactly as instructed without any explanation or note. Only generate the event indices where there is a location change, omit other events.",
