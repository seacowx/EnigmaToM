However, we can deduce the location of the drawer relative to Ella's movement. \n\nGiven that Ella was in the front_yard and moved the grapefruit to the drawer, it can be assumed that the drawer is now in the same location as Ella, but the exact location of the drawer is not explicitly stated. \n\nHowever, based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess that Ella is likely inside the house since she was able to move the grapefruit to the drawer. \n\nSo the location of the drawer can be inferred as follows:\n- Location of drawer is now inside the house."
