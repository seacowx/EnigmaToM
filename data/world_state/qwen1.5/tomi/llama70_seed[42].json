Yet, strictly following the information given without adding assumptions:\n\n- Drawer is now occupied.\n\nGiven the format and the need to follow instructions precisely without adding assumptions not directly supported by the text, the answer focusing strictly on provided actions without inference about being closed would be:\n\n- Drawer is now occupied.\n\nYet, this does not fully capture the likely state change of the drawer from empty to having an item (radish) in it, which is the most direct state change mentioned. Thus, focusing on the action directly related to the drawer:\n\nThe correct interpretation based on the action taken (moving the radish into the drawer) without assuming the state of the drawer being explicitly mentioned as closed or open, but recognizing it has undergone a state change by having an item placed in it, is:\n\n- Drawer is now occupied.\n\nThis reflects the change from presumably empty to containing an item without assuming the drawer's state as open or closed, which isn't directly stated.",

Since Elizabeth's movement does not change the state of the closet, only the following are relevant:\n- Closet is now empty of spinach.\n- Closet is now empty of Carter.\n\nBut the question asks for changes to \"closet\". The state of the closet is changed by the removal of the spinach and Carter, but it is also changed by their entry. The initial state of the closet and the changes are as follows:\n- Closet is now occupied by Elizabeth.\n- Closet is now occupied by Carter.\n- Closet is now empty of Carter.\n- Closet is now empty of spinach.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the final state change of the closet. Given the instructions and the events, the relevant state changes are:\n- Closet is now empty of spinach.\n- Closet is now empty of Carter.\n\nBut the question asks for the state change of the closet. Given the events, the state change of the closet is:\n- Closet is now empty of spinach and Carter, but occupied by Elizabeth.\n\nHowever, the instructions were to list state changes in the format - Closet is now [new state]. The correct state change is that the closet is now empty of spinach and Carter. The state of being occupied by Elizabeth is not a change since Elizabeth was already in the closet when the last event happened that changed the state of the closet. \n\nThe correct response is:\n- Closet is now empty of spinach and Carter.",
