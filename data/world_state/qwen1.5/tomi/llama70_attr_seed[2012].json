However, without explicit information about Hunter's search, we can only infer based on the context provided. Given that both are in the same room where an object of potential interest (the sweater in the box) is located, Carter might assume Hunter is searching for something, but the exact nature or object of the search is not specified. Thus, without direct evidence of Hunter searching, the perception might not change significantly based solely on the entrance into the kitchen. \n\nHowever, considering the context might imply a potential search (given the setup), a generous interpretation could be:\n\n- Carter's perception of hunter's search is now potentially active, as Hunter is in the location of the object (sweater in the box), but the specifics of what Hunter is searching for are unknown to Carter. \n\nBut strictly following the instruction for the format and the information given, the accurate response should reflect the lack of explicit change in Carter's perception due to the entrance alone:\n\nNone",

However, we can infer the current state based on who is inside and what is mentioned about the cellar. Given that:\n\n- The corn is in the crate.\n- The crate is in the cellar.\n- Ava likes the slippers (this does not directly affect the cellar's state).\n- Ava and Carter have both exited the cellar.\n\nThe cellar's state regarding its occupants is that it is empty of people, but it still contains the crate with the corn. Since the question asks for changes or the current state and given that the initial state of the cellar having people enter and exit is now that it is empty of people, we can describe the change as follows:\n\n- Cellar is now empty of people.\n- Cellar still contains the crate with the corn.",
