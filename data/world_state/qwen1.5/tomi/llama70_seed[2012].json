Given the events:\n\n- Sophia entered and then exited, so the room's occupancy state regarding Sophia changes.\n- Ava entered, so the room becomes occupied by Ava.\n\nThe presence of the bottle and underpants doesn't change the room's state in terms of occupancy or emptiness directly related to the characters' actions. Thus, focusing strictly on the room's state concerning the characters:\n\n- Master bedroom is now empty of Sophia.\n- Master bedroom is now occupied by Ava.\n\nHowever, considering the format and the question's focus on the room's state change due to the characters' actions, and given that \"master bedroom\" itself doesn't undergo a state change like being destroyed or locked, but rather its occupancy status changes:\n\nThe correct interpretation should be about the change in occupancy, which is already noted. But to strictly follow the instruction without adding extra information not directly asked for:\n\nNone",
