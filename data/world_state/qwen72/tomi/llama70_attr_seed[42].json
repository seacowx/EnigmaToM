However, the actual location of the treasure chest itself is not explicitly changed. But, given that Isabella moved the sweet potato to the treasure chest, it can be inferred that the treasure chest must be in the same location where Isabella is, which is the hall, because the action of moving the sweet potato to the treasure chest happened after Isabella entered the hall and before any exit that would have included Isabella. \n\nGiven the information provided and focusing strictly on the location of the treasure chest in relation to the provided actions and the fact that Isabella moved the sweet potato to it, we do not have explicit information about the treasure chest's location changing. The action implies the treasure chest's location is in the hall because that's where Isabella is when she performs the action. \n\nTherefore, the response based on the provided instructions and focusing on the change of the treasure chest's location as per the question's requirements would be:\n\n- Location of treasure chest is now in the hall.",
