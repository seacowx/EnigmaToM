Given the context, Noah's movements are still the same as before - he entered the crawlspace, moved the scarf, and then exited. However, since Oliver entered the crawlspace again after Noah exited, and there's no mention of Noah re-entering, the relevant change is in the context of who is in the crawlspace, not directly in Noah's movements. But considering the question asks for changes in \"the movements of Noah\" and there's been no alteration to what Noah did, the answer would reflect that there's no change in his movements based on the given actions. \n\nNone",
