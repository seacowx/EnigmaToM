However, the problem doesn't explicitly state that the box itself has changed state (e.g., from open to closed, or from empty to full), but we can imply that it has changed from empty to containing the persimmon. Therefore, the response could be:\n\n- Box is now containing the persimmon.\n\nHowever, following the exact format and the information given without adding extra interpretation, the correct answer should focus on the explicit state changes of the box itself as described, which in this context, is not detailed beyond its location and the action of having the persimmon moved into it. Thus, the most accurate response based on the given instructions and without adding additional interpretation is:\n\nNone"
