After the move, the basket must be in the same location as the peach. Given that the peach was initially in the bathtub and then moved, we can deduce the basket's location changed to be with the peach, but the exact location is not explicitly stated as being different from its original location. However, since the peach was moved from the bathtub to the basket, and there's no information suggesting the basket was moved, the most logical inference is that the basket was already in a location where Noah could move the peach to it. The location of the basket does not explicitly change in the given sequence of events, but since the peach was in the bathtub and is moved to the basket, and given the context, the basket must have been in a location accessible to Noah in the kitchen, as that is where the action of moving the peach to the basket occurs.\n\n- Location of basket is now in the kitchen.",
