Since the only state change of the master bedroom itself (not its contents) provided in the sequence is regarding its occupancy by Jacob, and considering the format requirement:\n\nThe answer should reflect the change in the master bedroom's state regarding being empty or occupied by Jacob, but since the format asks for \"[new state]\" without specifying the subject (Jacob), and given that \"empty\" might imply completely empty which is not the case (Mia and Mila are there), the accurate reflection of the change in state based on the given sequence and the format provided is not directly applicable as the sequence does not describe the master bedroom's state in such terms directly. \n\nThus, considering the need to adhere strictly to the format and the information given:\nNone",
