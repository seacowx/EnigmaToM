Since the question seems to ask for the outcome of \"melon\" and given the format provided, the most accurate response following the format for state changes is not directly applicable as it implies a sequence. The correct sequence of events for the melon is provided above, but the question's phrasing suggests a focus on the final state or the sequence of changes. Thus, the most fitting response, adhering strictly to the requested format for the final state, would be:\n\n- Melon is now in the blue treasure chest."
