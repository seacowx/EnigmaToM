This action does not change the relative locations of Hunter and the persimmon; Hunter is still outside the cellar, and the persimmon is inside the cellar.\n5. Hunter enters the TV room. This action does not change the fact that Hunter is outside the cellar where the persimmon is.\n\nGiven these steps, the location of the persimmon in relation to Hunter changes from being in the same room to being in different rooms.
