However, the text does not explicitly state that ownership has been transferred. \n\nGiven the information provided and the actions taken, the most logical interpretation regarding the \"ownership of boots\" is that it hasn't been explicitly changed or transferred to anyone. The movement of the boots by Mason could imply a change in possession or control, but \"ownership\" typically implies a more formal or legal transfer, which isn't clearly indicated here.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the specific request for the format of the answer regarding the \"ownership of boots,\" the response should reflect that there's no explicit change in ownership as per the details provided.\n\nNone"

However, based on the actions described, we can infer the following about the state of the boots:\n\n- Ownership of boots is now with Mason, as Mason was the one who moved them, implying control over the boots.\n \nNote: The term \"ownership\" here is used loosely since the text doesn't explicitly state ownership transfer, but rather physical movement and control."
