However, given the information provided, the location of the container is not directly changed by any action described after Carter exited the closet. The action of moving the spinach to the envelope does imply the spinach (and possibly the container, if we consider the spinach's movement as an indicator of the container's movement) is no longer in its original location. But since the container itself is not explicitly mentioned to be moved, we should be cautious in our interpretation.\n\nHowever, considering the logical flow and the fact that the spinach was in the container, and Elizabeth moved the spinach, it suggests that the container's location could have changed as well, because the spinach was moved.
