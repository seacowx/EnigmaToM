Given that Noah moved the sweater to the container earlier, here are the potential state changes for the container:\n\n- Container is now closed (assuming it was open when the sweater was moved into it).\n- Container is now occupied (since it contains the sweater).\n\nHowever, without explicit information about the container's state change, these are assumptions based on typical interactions with containers. The explicit information provided does not directly state a change in the container's state beyond it now containing the sweater, which was already established. Therefore, based strictly on the provided sequence without assuming additional actions or states not mentioned:\n\nNone",
