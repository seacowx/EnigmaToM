But since she was initially in the kitchen and now she has exited, and given the context of other characters entering the attic, it can be inferred that she might be heading towards the attic, but it's not explicitly stated. \n\nHowever, based on the information given, we can only confirm that she is no longer in the kitchen. Therefore, the response should reflect the change from the kitchen to an unknown location, but since the format requires a specific location, and we cannot assume, the correct interpretation of the instruction is:\n\n- Location of emma is now outside the kitchen.\n\nBut since \"outside the kitchen\" is not a specific room and the instruction format seems to require a specific location, and given that the instruction also allows for \"None\" if the location does not change to a specific new state, and considering the format strictly, the most accurate response based on the information given and the format required would actually be:\n\nNone",
