Therefore, the correct response should focus on the fact that the green bucket's state change of interest (having the plum inside) happened when Evelyn moved the plum to it, and there's no further state change mentioned for the green bucket itself or its contents in the subsequent events.\n\nGiven the strict format and focusing on state changes of the \"green bucket\" itself as per the instructions, and considering the events provided do not explicitly mention any further state change for the green bucket (like being moved or emptied), the response should reflect the understanding that the green bucket's relevant state change was when it had the plum moved into it, but since that's a past event and not a new state change from the last event, the correct interpretation of the instructions leads to:\n\nNone"

Thus, considering the format and focusing on direct actions to the \"green envelope\":\n\n- Green envelope is now containing the pear.\n \nGiven the constraints of the format and focusing strictly on changes to the \"green envelope\" as an object, the most accurate response based on the provided sequence of events would be:\n\n- Green envelope is now containing the pear.\n\nBut since the question seems to ask for changes in the state of the \"green envelope\" itself (like open, closed, moved, etc.), and assuming the \"green envelope\" was initially empty and then had the pear moved into it, the most fitting response under the constraints given would actually be:\n\n- Green envelope is now containing the pear.\n\nYet, considering the strict format and the implication that we're discussing state changes like open/closed or similar, and given that the pear's movement into the envelope is the action, not a state change of the envelope itself, the correct interpretation of the task would lead to recognizing that the question's scope might be about the envelope's state (open, closed) rather than its contents. Thus, without explicit mention of the envelope being opened or closed in relation to its state change, the precise answer following the format and focusing on the envelope's state (not its contents) would be:\n\nNone"

However, the question asks for state changes in a specific format. Given the lemon's movements, here are the state changes:\n\n- Lemon is now in the blue pantry.\n- Lemon is now in the blue crate.\n- Lemon is now in the green basket.\n- Lemon is now in the green drawer.\n\nThese are the state changes of the lemon as it moves from one location to another."

However, since the question asks about the state change of the \"blue crate\" and it was initially implied to be empty (as the green pepper was moved into it), after the events, the state of the blue crate is still that it contains the green pepper, but since that was the state after Logan's action, the state change relevant to the question would be that the blue crate is now empty if the green pepper were to be removed, but that did not happen in the given events. The correct interpretation of the question seems to be about any change in the state of the blue crate due to the given sequence of events, and the state of the blue crate changed from empty (implied initial state) to containing the green pepper (after Logan's action), but since the question's scope seems to be about changes after the initial action of moving the pepper, and there's no further action on the blue crate, the relevant state change to report would be if the crate's state were to change again, which it doesn't in the provided sequence. Therefore, given the specific phrasing of the question and the sequence of events, the answer provided initially might seem to misunderstand the question's intent. The correct understanding should be that the blue crate's state change relevant to the question's apparent intent (changes after the initial movement of the pepper) is not directly addressed by the events following Logan's action, as there are no further actions on the blue crate. Thus, the correct response, adhering strictly to the format requested and the events provided, should reflect the understanding that the question seems to seek a state change of the blue crate after it was last interacted with, which does not occur in the given sequence. \n\nHowever, given the strict format and the implication that we're discussing state changes after the initial movement and any claim's impact on our knowledge of the crate's state, and considering the events provided do not include further actions on the blue crate, the most fitting response, following the requested format and focusing on the change in the crate's state due to the actions described, would actually be to note the change from an implied empty state to containing the pepper, but since that's the state after Logan's action and not a change that occurs after, the correct interpretation of the question seems to lead to recognizing"

However, given the context of the question seems to focus on the container's state in relation to the people and actions described, and considering the container's state as \"empty\" might imply it's empty of spinach as well, it's essential to note the container still has spinach. But to follow the instructions precisely without making assumptions beyond the format provided:\n\n- Blue container is now empty.\n\nHowever, considering the need for accuracy in relation to the provided context and focusing strictly on the container's state as it directly relates to the described actions and the format:\n\nThe correct interpretation should reflect the container's state concerning the actions described. Given the format and focusing on changes to the \"blue container\" as a result of the described actions:\n\n- Blue container contains spinach.\n\nThis reflects the last action directly impacting the blue container's state.",
