The movement of the underpants and Avery's exit are state changes for the playroom's contents and occupancy, respectively. So the correct answer should be:\n\n- Playroom is now occupied.\n\nHowever, the playroom was occupied before James moved the underpants. The correct list of state changes should include the change from empty (or unoccupied) to occupied and the change in its contents. But since the playroom was already occupied when the underpants were moved, the correct list should be:\n\n- Playroom is now occupied.\n\nBut Avery exited. So the correct list of state changes should be:\n\n- Playroom is now occupied.\n- Playroom is now empty of Avery.\n\nHowever, James is still in the playroom. So the correct answer should be:\n\n- Playroom is now occupied.\n \nThe playroom's state changed from empty (or un"

The movement of the grapefruit into the drawer is an action involving the drawer but doesn't necessarily imply a state change of the drawer (like from open to closed). Given the strict format and the context provided:\n\n- Drawer is now containing the grapefruit.\n\nBut since this doesn't fit the typical interpretation of \"state change\" as it relates to the object itself (like open/closed, in use/not in use, etc.), and considering the movement of the grapefruit as an action rather than a state change of the drawer, the most accurate response based on the question's constraints and focusing strictly on the drawer's inherent state (like open, closed, etc.) would be:\n\nNone",
