Given the events:\n\n- Sophia entered and then exited, so the room's occupancy state regarding Sophia changes.\n- Ava entered, so the room becomes occupied by Ava.\n\nThe presence of the bottle and underpants doesn't change the room's state in terms of occupancy or emptiness directly related to the characters' actions. Thus, focusing strictly on the room's state concerning the characters:\n\n- Master bedroom is now empty of Sophia.\n- Master bedroom is now occupied by Ava.\n\nHowever, considering the format and the question's focus on the room's state change due to the characters' actions, and given that \"master bedroom\" itself doesn't undergo a state change like being destroyed or locked, but rather its occupancy status changes:\n\nThe correct interpretation should be about the change in occupancy, which is already noted. But to strictly follow the instruction without adding extra information not directly asked for:\n\n- Master bedroom is now occupied by Ava.\n\nGiven the instruction to list state changes or say \"None\" if there are no changes, and focusing on the room's state concerning the question's context (occupancy), the most accurate response based on the provided events and the required format is:\n\n- Master bedroom is now occupied by Ava.\n\nBut since the question seems to ask for any state change and given the events provided, the detailed response should consider all relevant changes. Yet, for simplicity and adherence to the format, focusing on the direct question:\n\nThe answer should reflect the change in the room's occupancy status directly resulting from the described actions."
