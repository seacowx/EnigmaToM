However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the initial location of the treasure chest. Given the information provided, we can only conclude that the treasure chest's contents have changed, not necessarily its location. But since the question asks about the location and assuming the location could imply where it is in relation to other objects or its state, we could consider the change in its contents as a change in its state. Therefore, the response based on the given instructions and focusing strictly on location as per the question's possible interpretation would be:\n\nNone \n\nHowever, if we were to consider the change in contents as relevant, the correct interpretation of the instruction to provide the new state as bullet points would be misaligned because the question specifically asks for the location. The actual change is in the contents, not the location. Thus, sticking strictly to the format and the question's apparent focus on physical location:\n\nNone",

Given the information provided:\n\n- The people (Ella and Ava) and the broccoli's movement are noted, but there's no direct action described that alters the hall itself or its contents in a way that would change its state as a location.\n- Ella exited the hall, but this doesn't change the hall's state as a location.\n- Ava moved the broccoli to the drawer, which means the broccoli is no longer in the crate in the hall, but this action doesn't inherently change the hall's state as a location.\n\nTherefore, considering the direct question about the \"location of hall,\" the hall itself hasn't undergone a change in state due to the described actions. The actions (people entering, exiting, and moving items) don't alter the hall's existence or its general state as a location. \n\nNone"
