However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the initial state of the laundry. Assuming it was initially unoccupied, the state changes are as follows:\n\nSince the problem asks for state changes of \"laundry\" and it's reasonable to consider occupancy as a state, the answer would be:\n\n- Laundry is now occupied by Emily and the crate.\n- Laundry is now unoccupied by Ethan, but still occupied by Emily and the crate.\n\nHowever, the most straightforward interpretation of the instructions would be to only consider the entry and exit of people, and the presence of objects as given conditions rather than state changes. In that case:\n\n- Laundry is now occupied by Emily.\n- Laundry is now unoccupied by Ethan.\n\nGiven the format and the instruction to list state changes, and assuming the initial state of the laundry is what's implied (unoccupied or empty of people), a more precise answer following the format and focusing strictly on changes due to the described actions would be:\n\n- Laundry is now occupied by Emily.\n- Laundry is now unoccupied by Ethan.\n\nBut since \"None\" is an option and the question might imply looking for changes in a broader sense (like dirty/clean, open/closed, etc., which are not mentioned), and given the instruction to list as bullet points for state changes:\n\nIf we strictly follow the given instructions without assuming additional context:\n- Laundry is now occupied by Emily.\n- Laundry is now unoccupied by Ethan.\n\nHowever, considering the simplicity and directness of the question, and focusing on changes to \"laundry\" as implied by actions (entering/exiting), the most fitting response under the constraints provided, and considering \"laundry\" as having states of occupancy:\n\nThe correct interpretation under the provided instructions and focusing on the action's impact on \"laundry\" as a location would indeed consider entry and exit as state changes. Thus, the accurate response reflecting changes due to the actions described, without over-assuming the initial state or the nature of the changes beyond occupancy, would acknowledge the entry and exit as they directly relate to \"laundry\". \n\nGiven the direct actions and their impact on \"laundry\", and focusing on providing a response that adheres to the format and the question's apparent scope:\n\nThe answer should reflect the changes in occupancy as directly resulting from the described actions.",

Given Chloe is still in the sunroom, the most accurate response regarding state changes of the \"sunroom\" would be:\n\n- Sunroom is now empty of melon.\n- Sunroom is now empty of Charlotte. \n\nBut since the format requires a focus on the state of the \"sunroom\" and considering the presence or absence of objects or people as its state, and Chloe's entry and continued presence doesn't change with the given actions, the response should acknowledge the change in the sunroom's state due to the melon's and Charlotte's departure:\n\n- Sunroom is now empty of melon.\n- Sunroom is now empty of Charlotte.\n\nYet, the question seems to seek a singular or direct state change of the \"sunroom\".
