I love golden retrievers. Does Bentley like to play outside?\nElliott: Yes, Bentley loves to play fetch in the park.\nMaggie: That sounds like fun. I'm sure Bentley gets hot during the summer.\nElliott: Yes, so we make sure to give Bentley plenty of water to drink.\n\nGiven this context, if \"bentley\" undergoes state changes, they could be:\n- Bentley is now thirsty.\n- Bentley is now hot.\n- Bentley is now hydrated.\n- Bentley is now tired.\n\nHowever, without the actual conversation, this is purely speculative.
