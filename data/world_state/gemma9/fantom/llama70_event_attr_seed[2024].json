In this scenario:\n  - Local businesses stimulation by concerts and music festivals is now enhanced.\n\n- If the 9% of the U.S. GDP is diverted away from the music and festival industry, it could lead to a decline in the number of concerts and music festivals, thereby reducing the stimulation of local businesses. In this scenario:\n  - Local businesses stimulation by concerts and music festivals is now diminished.\n\nWithout more specific information about the nature of the 9% GDP allocation, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.
