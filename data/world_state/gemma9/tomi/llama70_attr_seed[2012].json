However, the question asks about the actions of Noah undergoing changes.

Entering the crawlspace\n2. Moving the scarf to the bottle\n3. Exiting the crawlspace\n\nAnd it's mentioned that Noah loves the t-shirt, but this is not an action he performed in the sequence provided, rather a state of being.\n\nSince there's no direct change to the actions Noah performed as described, but rather additional information about his state (loving the t-shirt), the response to whether the actions of Noah have undergone changes would be based on the interpretation of the question. If we're strictly talking about the actions (entering, moving, exiting), there's no change.
