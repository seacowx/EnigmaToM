However, since the question asks for state changes of the \"bedroom\" itself, the correct interpretation of the question would likely be about the people or objects in the room, or other conditions of the room. \n\nA more suitable answer, following the exact format and focusing on the state of the \"bedroom\" as a location, would be:\n\n- Bedroom is now without Ava.\n- Bedroom is now without gloves in the suitcase, but with gloves in the pantry. \n\nHowever, the most accurate response, given the format and focusing strictly on the state of the \"bedroom\" as a location and considering typical interpretations of such scenarios, would be:\n\n- Bedroom is now without Ava.\n- Bedroom is now with gloves in pantry.\n\nBut since the question seems to be asking about any change in the state of the \"bedroom\", and considering the provided events, the most straightforward and detailed answer, while a bit redundant, would acknowledge the change in occupants and objects within it. Thus, the response could be simplified or expanded based on the interpretation of what constitutes a \"state change\" of a room. \n\nGiven the constraints and focusing on changes to the room's state directly related to the events described:\n\n- Bedroom is now without Ava.\n- Bedroom is now with gloves in pantry.\n\nYet, considering the format and the question's possible implications on the \"bedroom's\" state, if we strictly interpret \"state changes\" as direct alterations to the room itself or its contents as described, the answer could be seen as:\n\nNone \n\nThis is because the \"bedroom\" itself doesn't change; it's the contents and occupants that do. However, the detailed breakdown above aims to address potential interpretations of the question.",

However, since the question asks for state changes of the \"office\", and assuming the state refers to the office being occupied or empty, the correct response based on the given format would be:\n\n- Office is now occupied. \n\nHowever, considering the instruction to the letter as requested, and given that \"occupied\" might not fully capture the change (since it was already occupied by Jackson when Mason exited), a more precise answer following the format and focusing on the state change of the office (occupied or empty) isn't directly applicable. The events provided do not explicitly state the office becoming empty or any other physical state change of the office itself. Thus, adhering strictly to the format and the question's apparent intent:\n\nNone",
