The people and objects within it are part of its state. \n\nHowever, given the format and the context of the question, it seems more appropriate to focus on whether the room itself has changed state in a more abstract or general sense (e.g., locked/unlocked, clean/dirty, etc.), which isn't directly addressed by the sequence of events provided. The events describe changes in the room's contents and occupancy, not the room's intrinsic state.\n\nGiven this interpretation, the most fitting response based on the provided instructions and focusing on a general interpretation of \"state changes\" to the master bedroom as a whole would be:\n\nNone",
