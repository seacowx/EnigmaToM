The office initially has the cabbage in the crate and then Lucas enters. Noah enters and exits. The state change relevant to the office is Lucas entering and Noah exiting. However, the question seems to ask for a final state change of the office. Considering this, the answer should reflect the final state of the office after all actions have been taken into account. \n\nGiven the provided sequence of events and focusing on changes to the \"office\", the correct interpretation of the question's request for state changes should consider what happens to the office as a result of the described actions. The office initially has the crate with cabbage, then Lucas and Noah enter, and Noah exits. The final state of the office, considering the provided actions and the question's request, should account for who or what is in the office after these actions.\n\nThe correct answer, considering the need to provide the final state of the office after all described actions and focusing on the format requested, should be:\n\n- Office is now occupied by Lucas.\nHowever, since the question asks for state changes and given that the office's initial state (other than having the crate with cabbage) and subsequent states are not explicitly detailed in the provided options for answering, the most accurate response, following the format and focusing on the \"office\" as the subject of state changes, is:\n\n- Office is now occupied by Lucas.\n\nBut, considering the instructions to the letter as requested and the format provided for the answer, if we are to list all state changes of the office as the subject:\n\n- Office is now occupied by Lucas and Noah.\n- Office is now occupied by Lucas.\n\nGiven the constraints of the format and the need to provide a final state of the office after all actions have been considered, and focusing on the subject of the state changes being the office, the correct interpretation of the actions and the question's request should be:\n\nThe office's state changes"
