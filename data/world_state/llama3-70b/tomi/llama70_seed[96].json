Since the crawlspace starts empty, then becomes occupied by Hunter, then occupied by Hunter and Emma, then Hunter exits and re-enters, the significant state change is:\n- Crawlspace is now occupied.\n\nBut the question might be asking about a different type of state change, such as the crawlspace being locked or unlocked, which is not mentioned in the given events. In that case, the answer would be:\nNone",
