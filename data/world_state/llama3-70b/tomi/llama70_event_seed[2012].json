Evelyn entered the lounge.\n3. Nathan moved grapes from cupboard to pantry.\n4. Evelyn exited the lounge.\n5. Jacob became aware of Evelyn and Nathan.\n6. Jacob loves beans.\n7. Grapes were in the cupboard.\n\nFrom the given events, we see that:\n- Initially, it's stated that grapes were in the cupboard (event 7).\n- Then, Nathan moved grapes from the cupboard to the pantry (event 3).\n\nSo, the state changes of the grapes are:\n- Grapes are now in the pantry.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the state changes in a specific format and considering the initial and final states based on the sequence of events provided, the correct interpretation of the events leads to understanding that the grapes were moved. But given the format and the need to strictly follow instructions, the focus should be on the direct implications of the events as they relate to the grapes' location:\n\n- Grapes are now in the pantry.\n\nGiven the strict format requirement and focusing on the direct question about the grapes' state change as per the events, the correct response to the question about what happens to \"grapes\" and listing state changes as requested would be:\n\n- Grapes is now in the pantry."

Nathan entered the lounge.\n2. Evelyn entered the lounge.\n3. Nathan moved grapes from cupboard to pantry.\n4. Evelyn exited the lounge.\n5. Jacob became aware of Evelyn and Nathan.\n6. Jacob loves beans.\n7. Grapes were in the cupboard.\n8. Cupboard and pantry are in the lounge.\n\nFrom the given events, we can see that the grapes were initially in the cupboard (event 7) and then moved to the pantry by Nathan (event 3). There's no mention of the grapes being moved again after that. \n\nSo, the state changes of the grapes are:\n- Grapes were in the cupboard.\n- Grapes are now in the pantry.\n\nGiven the format you requested, the answer focusing on the change is:\n- Grapes is now in the pantry."

In the context of the question, which seems to seek a singular \"location\" state change, the interpretation might differ. Given the movements and actions described, if we're to consider \"location\" as a broad term for where actions are happening or where characters and objects are:\n\n- Location is now workshop.\n- Location is now pantry.\n- Location is now dining room.\n- Location is now outside dining room.\n\nBut since the question seems to ask for changes in a singular \"location\" and given the format provided, it seems more aligned to track the change in the primary location of action or focus, which shifts from the workshop to the pantry and then to the dining room, and finally outside the dining room. Thus, focusing strictly on the format and the implication of tracking a singular \"location\" state change:\n\n- Location is now workshop.\n- Location is now pantry.\n- Location is now dining room.\n- Location is now outside dining room.\n\nGiven the format and the need to simplify the response to match the question's apparent expectation for a singular \"location\" and its state changes:\n\n- Location is now workshop.\n- Location is now pantry.\n- Location is now dining room.\n- Location is now outside dining room.",
