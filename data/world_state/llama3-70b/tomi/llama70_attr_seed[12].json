After Mason moved the boots, the location of the container is still unknown, but we can infer it is now in the same location as the boots. However, the location of the container itself is not explicitly changed in the given events, but we can make an educated guess based on the action. \n\nGiven the information provided and the action taken by Mason, the most logical inference is that the container's location is now the same as where Mason is, which is the closet, because Mason was in the closet when he moved the boots to the container. However, without explicit information about the container's initial location or any movement of the container itself, we cannot definitively state the location of the container has changed based on the given instructions. \n\nTherefore, based strictly on the information given and the format requested:\n- Location of container is now in the closet."
