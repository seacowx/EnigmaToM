Apple moved to red box: Similar to the previous moves, Hannah doesn't observe this as she's outside the closet.\n7. Lily exits closet: Lily leaves the closet.

Initially, Noah likes the green envelope (Event 4).\n2. Cherry is moved from the green envelope to the blue bucket by Owen (Event 5), but Noah is not directly informed of this change in the events provided.\n3. Noah claims cherry is in the green envelope (Event 17), indicating he is unaware of the change made by Owen.\n4. Ella tells Noah that cherry is in the blue bottle (Event 18), which updates Noah's knowledge about the location of cherry.\n\nGiven these events, the perception of Noah undergoes changes as follows:\n\n- Perception of Noah is now that cherry is in the blue bottle, as informed by Ella.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the format to be followed to the letter and the change is not directly about a state but an object's location, and considering the instructions:\n\n- Perception of Noah is now that cherry is in the blue bottle."
