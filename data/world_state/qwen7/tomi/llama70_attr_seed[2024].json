However, the initial state of the envelope's location is not provided, so we cannot determine if it has changed or not. But given the context that William and Mason were in the attic and the action of moving the banana to the envelope happened after they entered the attic, and there's no mention of them leaving with the envelope or the envelope being moved, we can make an educated guess about the current state of the envelope's location based on the information given:\n\n- Location of envelope is now in the attic."
