However, the actual location of the treasure chest itself was not specified to have changed. Given the information provided and the specific format requested for the answer, the most accurate response based on the details given would be:\n\n- Location of treasure chest is now in the hallway, containing the scarf.\n\nThis response assumes that since the suitcase (which initially contained the scarf) was in the hallway, and Aiden moved the scarf to the treasure chest, the treasure chest must also be in the hallway for Aiden to have accessed it. However, without explicit information about the treasure chest's original location, this is an inference based on the context provided."
