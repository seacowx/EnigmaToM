However, we do know that the drawer was initially in the front_yard, and then Isla and Amelia exited the front_yard. But the key point is that the drawer's location is tied to the front_yard, and Chloe is the only one left in the front_yard. \n\nGiven that, the location of the drawer doesn't change because of the movement of the peas, but since the drawer was in the front_yard and the people (except Chloe) left, it implies the drawer is still in the front_yard with Chloe.\n\nSo, the response is:\nNone",
                    "location of peas": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- Location of peas is now the cupboard.",
                    "chloe's action on peas": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n- Chloe's action on peas is now moved to the cupboard.",
                    "location of cupboard": "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nSince the initial state doesn't mention the location of the cupboard, and Chloe moved the peas to the cupboard, we can infer that the cupboard is now in the same location as Chloe, which is the front_yard, but the exact location of the cupboard wasn't changed, it was just used. However, given the information provided and the action taken, we can infer the cupboard's location as follows:\n\n- Location of cupboard is now in the front_yard."
